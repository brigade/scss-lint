`scss-lint` is a tool to help keep your [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com) files
clean and readable. You can run it manually from the command-line, or integrate
it into your [SCM hooks](https://github.com/causes/overcommit). It uses rules
established by the team at [Causes.com](https://causes.com).

## Requirements

* Ruby 1.9.3+
* Sass 3.4+ (`scss-lint` 0.27.0 was the last version to support Sass 3.3)
* Files you wish to lint must be written in SCSS (not Sass) syntax

## Installation

```bash
gem install scss-lint
```

## Usage

Run `scss-lint` from the command-line by passing in a directory (or multiple
directories) to recursively scan:

```bash
scss-lint app/assets/stylesheets/
```

You can also specify a list of files explicitly:

```bash
scss-lint app/assets/stylesheets/**/*.css.scss
```

`scss-lint` will output any problems with your SCSS, including the offending
filename and line number (if available).

Command Line Flag         | Description
--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------
`-c`/`--config`           | Specify a configuration file to use
`-e`/`--exclude`          | Exclude one or more files from being linted
`-f`/`--format`           | Output format (see [Formatters](#formatters))
`-o`/`--out`              | Write output to a file instead of STDOUT
`-r`/`--require`          | Require file/library (mind `$LOAD_PATH`, uses `Kernel.require`)
`-i`/`--include-linter`   | Specify which linters you specifically want to run
`-x`/`--exclude-linter`   | Specify which linters you _don't_ want to run
`-h`/`--help`             | Show command line flag documentation
`--show-formatters`       | Show all available formatters
`--show-linters`          | Show all available linters
`-v`/`--version`          | Show version

## Configuration

`scss-lint` will automatically recognize and load any file with the name
`.scss-lint.yml` as a configuration file. It loads the configuration based on
the location of the file being linted, starting from that file's directory and
ascending until a configuration file is found. Any configuration loaded is
automatically merged with the default configuration (see `config/default.yml`).

Here's an example configuration file:

```yaml
inherit_from: '../../inherited-config.yml'

scss_files: 'app/assets/stylesheets/**/*.css.scss'

exclude: 'app/assets/stylesheets/plugins/**'

linters:
  BorderZero:
    enabled: false

  Indentation:
    exclude:
      - 'path/to/file.scss'
      - 'path/to/directory/**'
    severity: warning
    width: 2
```

All linters have an `enabled` option which can be `true` or `false`, which
controls whether the linter is run, along with linter-specific options. The
defaults are defined in `config/default.yml`.

### Severities

The `severity` option allows you to specify whether the lint should be treated
as a `warning` or an `error`. Warnings cause `scss-lint` to exit with a
different error code than errors (unless both warnings _and_ errors are
present, in which case the `error` exit code is returned). This is useful when
integrating `scss-lint` with build systems or other executables, as you can
rely on its exit status code to indicate whether a lint actually requires
attention.

### Extending Configurations

The `inherit_from` directive allows a configuration file to inherit settings
from another configuration file. The file specified by `inherit_from` is loaded
and then merged with the settings in the current file (settings in the current
file overrule those in the inherited file).

### Excluding Files

The `exclude` directive allows you to specify a glob pattern of files that
should not be linted by `scss-lint`. Paths are relative to the location of the
config file itself if they are not absolute paths. If an inherited file
specifies the `exclude` directive, the two exclusion lists are combined. Any
additional exclusions specified via the `--exclude` flag are also combined. If
you need to exclude files for a single linter you can specify the list of files
using the linter's `exclude` configuration option.

### Explicit Configuration File

You can also configure `scss-lint` by specifying a file via the `--config`
flag, but note that this will override any configuration files that `scss-lint`
would normally find on its own (this can be useful for testing a particular
configuration setting, however). Configurations loaded this way will still be
merged with the default configuration specified by `config/default.yml`.

### Generating a Configuration

To start using `scss-lint` you can use the [`Config` Formatter](#config),
which will generate an `.scss-lint.yml` configuration file with all linters
which caused a lint disabled. Starting with this as your configuration
you can slowly enable each linter and fix any lints one by one.

## Formatters

### Default

The default formatter is intended to be easy to consume by both humans and
external tools.

```bash
scss-lint [scss-files...]
```

```
test.scss:2 [W] StringQuotes: Prefer single quoted strings
test.scss:2 [W] Indentation: Line should be indented 0 spaces, but was indented 1 space
test.scss:5 [W] StringQuotes: Prefer single quoted strings
test.scss:6 [W] UrlQuotes: URLs should be enclosed in quotes
```

The default formatter tries to colorize the output using
[Rainbow](https://github.com/sickill/rainbow#windows-support), which will
silently fail on Windows systems if the gems
[windows-pr](https://rubygems.org/gems/windows-pr) and
[win32console](https://rubygems.org/gems/win32console)
are not installed.
[Read more about adding Windows support](https://github.com/sickill/rainbow#windows-support).

### Config

Returns a valid `.scss-lint.yml` configuration where all linters which caused
a lint are disabled. Starting with this as your configuration, you can slowly
enable each linter and fix any lints one by one.

```bash
scss-lint --format=Config [scss-files...]
```

```yaml
linters:
  Indentation:
    enabled: false
  StringQuotes:
    enabled: false
  UrlQuotes:
    enabled: false
```

### Files

Useful when you just want to open all offending files in an editor. This will
just output the names of the files so that you can execute the following to
open them all:

```bash
scss-lint --format=Files [scss-files...] | xargs vim
```

### JSON

Outputs JSON with filenames and an array of issue objects.

```json
{
  "test.css": [
    {"line": 2, "severity": "warning", "reason": "Prefer single quoted strings"},
    {"line": 2, "severity": "warning", "reason": "Line should be indented 0 spaces, but was indented 1 spaces"},
    {"line": 5, "severity": "warning", "reason": "Prefer single quoted strings"},
    {"line": 6, "severity": "warning", "reason": "URLs should be enclosed in quotes"}
  ]
}
```

### XML

Outputs XML with `<lint>`, `<file>`, and `<issue>` tags. Suitable for
consumption by tools like [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/).

```bash
scss-lint --format=XML [scss-files...]
```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<lint>
  <file name="test.css">
    <issue line="2" severity="warning" reason="Prefer single quoted strings" />
    <issue line="2" severity="warning" reason="Line should be indented 0 spaces, but was indented 1 spaces" />
    <issue line="5" severity="warning" reason="Prefer single quoted strings" />
    <issue line="6" severity="warning" reason="URLs should be enclosed in quotes" />
  </file>
</lint>
```

## Exit Status Codes

`scss-lint` tries to use
[semantic exit statuses](http://www.gsp.com/cgi-bin/man.cgi?section=3&topic=sysexits)
wherever possible, but the full list of codes and the conditions under which they are
returned is listed here for completeness.

Exit Status | Description
------------|-------------------------------------------------------------
`0`         | No lints were found
`1`         | Lints with a severity of `warning` were reported (no errors)
`2`         | One or more errors were reported (and any number of warnings)
`64`        | Command line usage error (invalid flag, etc.)
`66`        | One or more files specified were not found
`70`        | Unexpected error (i.e. a bug); please [report it](https://github.com/causes/scss-lint/issues)
`78`        | Invalid configuration file; your [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) is likely incorrect

## Linters

`scss-lint` is a customizable tool with opinionated defaults that helps you
enforce a consistent style in your SCSS. For these opinionated defaults, we've
had to make calls about what we think are the "best" style conventions, even
when there are often reasonable arguments for more than one possible style.

Should you want to customize the checks run against your code, you can do so by
editing your [configuration file](#configuration) to match your
preferred style.

## Editor Integration

### Vim

You can have `scss-lint` automatically run against your SCSS files after saving
by using the [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) plugin. If
you already have the plugin, just add
`let g:syntastic_scss_checkers = ['scss_lint']` to your `.vimrc`.

### Sublime Text

Install the
[Sublime scss-lint plugin](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/SublimeLinter-contrib-scss-lint).

### Atom

Install the [Atom scss-lint plugin](https://atom.io/packages/linter-scss-lint). It is a part of the [`atomlinter`](https://atom.io/users/atomlinter) project, so if you are already using other linter plugins, you can keep them in one place.

### Emacs

Install and enable both [scss-mode](https://github.com/antonj/scss-mode) and [flycheck-mode](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck). You can enable automatic linting for scss-mode buffers with `(add-hook 'scss-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode)` in your `init.el`.
